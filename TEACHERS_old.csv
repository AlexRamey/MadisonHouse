""how many different volunteers would you like per week?""
I'd like to have a volunteer every day if possible so I thought that the answer of 5 covered having one volunteer each day of the week. I could be wrong about this.

I'm dreaming big here with my listed requests, I know. My parent volunteer turnout is just one parent every other week so it's been a challenge to accomplish all that I want with an extra set of hands and give my struggling students some much needed intervention. 

I also checked multiple time slots for each day to indicate when in the day I need help. I know I probably can not get as much help as selected on the form, but like I said before...I'm going all out and seeing what help I can get from the days and times I listed. 

The earliest morning slots (8-9 or 8:30-9:30) would be one on one help with struggling students. 
The time slots of  9-10 and  are during our Language Arts rotations. I like volunteers to oversee games / activities of independent groups or work1:1 or 2:1 with a students who needs help finishing work or need extra practice with something.
The mid-afternoon slot is social studies on Wednesdays.
The later afternoon slot is writing time. The volunteer will help me assist students in their writing workshop, answer questions, proofread writing, or other writing help.

Hope my explanations help. Thanks so so much!!!

I'd love an extra set of hands each day to help with our Daily Five rounds. Volunteers would learn how students become more independent in an upper elementary classroom.

Volunteers would be able to see a wide range of learning styles and abilities within my two classes. Thank you!

I'm looking forward to having you all back again this year! I'll take any after school help I can get Mon-Wed and maybe Friday. Does Becca Stein volunteer through your program? If so, I'd love to request her as a volunteer and work out any hours that suit her. She worked for me this summer and was great! Also, the same for Becca Pryor - I know she didn't have a car. Just let me know what works for you and I'll work things out on my end. I have to check with my principal to see when our after school programming begins this fall. Could be students from grades other than 1st.
Take Care,
